# Word-Search-Puzzle
This article will contain the logic of how to solve a word search puzzle using Recursion-Backtracking Algorithm.
The question states:
You are given a 2D board( 'N' rows and 'M' columns) of characters and a string 'word'.
Your task is to return true if the given word exists in the grid, else return false.
The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighbouring.


The logic will be explained in the code itself.
So check out the code....
